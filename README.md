# sonnet-modules
A repo of sonnet command modules and dlib modules that extend sonnet to more obscure tasks  
This repo is open to all to submit their own modules or patch others
# Guidelines
- Modules should be submitted as /mod/<username>/<modulename>/\*
- Modules will include a README.md explaining what they do and the minimum sonnet version they require
## Example:
```bash
> ls GITROOT/mod/ultrabear/marketrep/
README.md cmd_marketrep.py
```
